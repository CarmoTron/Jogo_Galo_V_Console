This game was developed by me while I was attending school to become a Computer Programmer. 
We were asked to make the tic-tac-toe game.
In this tic-tac-toe game, I managed to overcome the difficulties I had, 
but I still need to fix some bugs that occur when resetting the game. 
Additionally, I intend to give it a nicer interface, rather than just using the console.
